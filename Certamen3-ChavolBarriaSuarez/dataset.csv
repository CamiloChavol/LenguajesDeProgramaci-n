10046,favorite billie project! me personally i liked hte better than dsam and wwafawdwg but only because every song on there is a bop ( except everybody dies 😵‍💫😵‍💫 ) but on wwafawdwg i have so many skips… same with dsam!!

10050,we need a billie song where finneas features in it... features as in he gets his own verses with billie as the background harmonies. a little flip flop action.
10051,kinda glad she declined

17608,what do you think when you listen to lacy?? i currently think it’s about a friend who you adore but they start to grow distant so you start to not envy her but more so that you see them as an illusion. not the same person that you grew to be friends with.
17609,"does anyone have this pic of olivia, but without the annoying symbol? i truly don’t understand why instagram doesn’t allow you to save photos."
17610,"authenticity on this stanley i wanted to buy this listing but i was wondering if it was authentic , there are reviews stating it is but i wanted to double check"

30004,"just got my recap! i think it's well presented, although i don't know how i listened to taylor swift that much😅 all i can say her new albums were magnificent this year"
30005,real time lyrics are gone! real time lyrics doesn't show up in any songs anymore. it started with a few songs and none of them show it now. wtf google
30006,"taylor swift albums disappeared from ytm? i noticed that some of her songs were no longer available on one of my playlists, so i went to her ytm page and it looks like only her “1989” album is available. that seems like a pretty big loss in terms of licensing... 🤷🏻‍♀️"
30007,"how to stop music/re-uploaded versions from playing instead of the fucking original i have premium 
these are the relevant settings in recommend(pic 2) and data saving(pic 3)

30023,anyone out there without the live lyrics yet? yall when is it gonna be available for all users 😭 it’s not like it is a big deal but i find annoying to see some people have it and others don’t
30024,i didn’t need to be called out like that 😂
30025,recap already surprised to be in the top 0.1% of taylor listeners yet only have 1 of her songs in my top tracks.  i guess because i listen to so many different ones

30043,"how can i make the cast icon disappear and make the skip song icon appear, it bothers me"
30044,"i'm no graphic designer, but the youtube music user interface has such a sad vibe. drab, pale, lots of black and white. compares poorly to the vibrant colors you find on apple music and elsewhere."
30045,"who decided that the original versions of folklore should be on the disney+ album? and how can i get them promoted to customer? i think it's cause of streaming counts, but idk. it's so annoying!"
30046,"can you move songs to different spots in a playlist? i have a taylor swift playlist that has all the albums in order but her new releases are just chilling at the end, not with the actual albums.

30073,"youtube music on tv is so buggy bro 🤦‍♂️ every time i add a song to the queue in my phone, the lyrics on the tv would just freeze."
30074,"why no percentage??? when i got my recap this year, it didn't give me a percentage to show how much i've listened to cannibal corpse.  did anyone else have this problem?"
30075,"what is this? are plays supposed to be streams?

30091,i think i've absolutely confused my ytm algorithm...
30092,is here comes the sun a sad song? youtube thinks it is
30093,auto play no longer an option? my autoplay button at the bottom of playlists no longer appears. it's not even on my liked playlist. is anyone having this problem? i really liked that option and it's weird it's just gone
30094,i like this season's one it actually felt correct
30095,youtube music now tells you how many likes a certain song has.

30108,first time for everything; my recap was actually fairly accurate for once! surprised billie eilish didn't somehow supercede some of these artists because of the one time i listened to happier than ever. youtube does like to do that to me normally.
30109,playing indicators come to ios after 5 years
30110,any fix for the offset gradient background or anyway to remove it all together?
30111,floating play button just noticed that playlists not have a floating button that appears when scrolling. handy! [ios]
